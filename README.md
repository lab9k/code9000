\#Code9000
===================
----------

\#Code9000 is a project in which Digipolis Ghent and the City of Ghent experiment with open data to create new open source proof-of-concepts. The project was developmed by oSoc17. This organisation collaborates with students to create IT-related projects. Students get real cases to work on and move beyond the theoretical and we get new learnings and code to test and iterate upon.

For this project, we wanted to observe the common tern, a bird living near the "Houtdok" in Ghent. tbc

####  Technologies
##### API
The API handles the pictures taken by the IoT-device. We use it to collect our pictures, save it and make it accessible for other services. Since we don't have another way of validating what creature triggered the infraredsensor, we are using a human voting system. Votes are send to the API, and when an image reaches a certain treshhold, the API will assume it's validated and send it forward.

The API is made in php, using the Laravel framework. We chose to include user accounts as it's the only way to know for sure one person can only vote once on a picture.

##### Webapplication
To do the validation of our pictures, human validation looked like the best way (given the time we had). As a simple yes-maybe-no validation onepager seemed a little dull and unappealing, we tried to gamify it.

We made a reactjs webapp where you can do all the account-related stuff like logging in or making an account. We made an voting page as well, and tried to implement fun features like scores, badges and a monthly leaderboard.
